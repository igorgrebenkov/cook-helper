                To delete a recipe from the list, click on the <i>Edit</i> button in the top
                right corner of the <i>Recipe List</i> page. A list of checkboxes will pop up
                next to each recipe's name. Select the recipe(s) you would like to delete, and press
                the <i>Delete</i> button to remove them from the list.

                An open recipe may be edited by tapping on the <i>Edit</i> button. This will
                make all the recipe's fields editable. To save your changes,
                tap on the <i>OK</i> button.
                To discard all changes, tap on the <i>Cancel</i> button.

            <h4>Adding a Recipe</h4>
            <p>
                Recipes are added by tapping the <i>Add</i> button on the <i>Recipe List</i>
                page. A new window will pop up containing a blank recipe. Edit the recipe as

            <h4>Searching for Recipes</h4>
            <p>
                To search for recipes from the recipe list, tap the <i>Search Recipes</i> button
                on the main screen. Searches may be performed by Ingredient/Category/Country.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following boolean operators may be used to combine search terms:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> AND </li>
                <li> OR </li>
                <li> NOT </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When more than one boolean operator is used, precedence of operations MUST be
                indicated with parentheses. For example, to search for the AND of three ingredients,
            </p>
            <div style="padding:12px;background-color:#d3d3d3;line-height:1.4;">
                (Ingredient1 AND Ingredient2) AND Ingredient3
            </div>
            <p>
                is the required input. Note that,
            </p>
            <div style="padding:12px;background-color:#d3d3d3;line-height:1.4;">
                Ingredient1 AND Ingredient2 AND Ingredient3
            </div>
            <p>
                is <i>not</i> correct.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, for the AND/OR of three ingredients,
            </p>
            <div style="padding:12px;background-color:#d3d3d3;line-height:1.4;">
                <font size = "1">
                    ((Ingredient1 AND Ingredient2) OR Ingredient3) AND Ingredient4
                </font>
            </div>
            <p>
                is the required input.
            </p>
            <p>
                Search results are sorted by the number of matching search terms. Recipes
                with the most matching search terms will be at the top, and the rest follow
                in descending order.
            </p>
